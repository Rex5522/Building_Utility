-- if your a contributer you can add your details here. i prefer that you do this in a separate request after i have accepted the your original request
G_Contributers = { -- all params except displayName and github are optional. but i suggest you add at least steam for anything i may add. for example ?contributers

        displayName = "<Rex> / T-REX-5522", -- limit of two. this should be a name your known by
        github = "Rex5522",
